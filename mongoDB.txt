The bootcamp i am using for my mongoDB study seems a bit old, not outdated, just old, unfamiliar but working syntax, and we are also learning on neutral ground which is the shell, due to difference in teck stack, will keep you updated
Well today i learnt:
1. Basics of CRUD operations
2. i also learnt the syntax for the CRUD operations for interacting via the shell which is similar to the syntax for when operating on a node.js project.

2. Update patient data of 1 patient with new age, name and history entry. 
3. Find all patients who are older than 30.

So i used this tasks to reinforce my mongoDB knowledge today.
